The Weather Forecasting App

ðŸŒ¤ Weather Forecast Web Application

This project is a responsive Weather Forecast Web Application built using HTML, CSS (Tailwind), and JavaScript. It integrates the WeatherAPI.com service to provide real-time global weather data and a 7-day forecast for any location worldwide.

The app automatically detects the userâ€™s current location using the browserâ€™s Geolocation API and displays the local weather conditions (temperature, humidity, wind speed, and sky description). Users can also search for weather anywhere in the world by typing a city name or coordinates.
